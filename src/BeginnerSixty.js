    'Tadasana - Stand erect with the feet together, the heels and big toes touching each other. Tighten the knees and pull the knee-caps up, contract the hips and pull up the muscles at the back of the thighs. Keep the stomach in, chest forward, spine stretched up and the neck straight. Do not bear the weight of the body either on the heels or the toes, but distribute it evenly on them both. Ideally in Tadasana the arms are stretched out over the head, but for the sake of convenience, one can place them by the side of the thighs. ',
    'Uttanasana - Stand in Tadasana, keeping the knees tight. Exhale, bend forward and place the fingers on the floor. Then place the palms on the floor by the side of the feet, behind the heels. Do not bend the legs at the knees.  Try to hold the head up and stretch the spine. Move the hips a little forward towards the head so as to bring the legs perpendicular to the floor. Remain in this position and take two deep breaths. Exhale, move the trunk closer to the legs and rest the head on the knees. Do not slacken the grip at the knees, but pull the knee-caps well up. Hold this position for a minute with deep and even breathing. Inhale and raise the head from the knees, but without lifting the palms from the floor. After two breaths, take a deep inhalation, lift the hands from the floor and come back to Tadasana.',
    'Utthita trikonasana - Stand in Tadasana. Inhale deeply and with a jump spread apart the legs sideways 3 to 4 feet. Raise the arms sideways, in line with the shoulders, palms facing down. Keep the arms parallel to the floor. Turn the right foot sideways 90 degrees to the right. Turn the left foot slightly to the right, keeping the left leg stretched out and tightened at the knee. Exhale, bend the trunk sideways to the right, bringing the right palm near the right ankle. If possible, the right palm should rest completely on the floor. Stretch the left arm up bringing it in line with the right shoulder and extend the trunk.

Keep the right knee locked tight by pulling up the knee-cap and keep the right knee facing the toes. Remain in this position from half a minute to a minute, breathing.',
    'Virabhadrasana I - Take a deep inhalation, and with a jump spread the legs apart sideways 4 to 4.5  feet. Raise the arms sideways in line with the shoulders, palms facing down. Turn the right foot sideways 90 degrees to the right and the left foot slightly to the right, keeping the left leg stretched out and tightened at the knee. Stretch the hamstring muscles of the left leg. Exhale and bend the right knee till the right thigh is parallel to the floor, keeping the right shin perpendicular to the floor, thus forming a right angle between the right thigh and the right calf. The bent knee should not extend beyond the ankle, but should be in line with the heel. Stretch out the hands sideways, as though two persons are pulling you from opposite ends. Turn the face to the right and gaze at the right palm. Stretch the back muscles of the left leg fully. The back of the legs, the dorsal region and the hips should be in one line.',
    'Virabhadrasana III - Stand in Tadasana. Raise both arms above the head; stretch up and join the palms. Take a deep inhalation and with a jump spread the legs apart sideways 4 to 4.5 feet. Exhale, turn to the right. Simultaneously turn the tight foot 90 degrees to the right and the left foot slightly to the right. Flex the right knee till the right thigh is parallel to the floor and the right shin perpendicular to the floor, forming a right angle  between the right thigh and the right calf. The bent knee should not extend beyond the ankle, but should be in line with the heel. Stretch out the left leg and tighten at the knee. The face, chest and right knee should face the same way as the right foot, as illustrated. Throw the head up, stretch the spine and gaze at the joined palms. Hold the pose from 20 seconds to half a minute with normal breathing.',
    'Utkatasana - Stand in Tadasana, stretch the arms straight over the head and join the palms, Exhale, bend the knees and lower the trunk till the thighs are parallel to the floor. Do not stoop forward, but keep the chest as far back as possible and breathe normally. Stay in the pose for a few seconds, 30 being sufficient, It is difficult to balance in this pose. Inhale, straighten the legs, lower the arms, come back to Tadasana and relax.',
    'Adho Mukha Svanasana - Lie full length on the floor on the stomach, face downwards. The feet should be kept one foot apart. Rest the palms by the side of the shoulder, the fingers straight and pointing in the direction of the head. Exhale and raise the trunk from the floor. Straighten the arms, move the head inwards towards the feet and place the crown of the head on the floor, keeping the elbows straight and extending the back. Keep the legs stiff and do not bend at the knees. The soles of the feet should rest completely on the floor, while the feet should be parallel to each other, the toes pointing straight ahead. Stay in the pose for about a minute with deep breathing. Then with an exhalation lift the head off the floor, stretch the trunk forward and lower the body gently to the floor and relax.',
    'Bhujangasana - Lie flat on the floor on the stomach. Bend the elbows and place the palms on the floor on either side of the waist.

    'Setu Bandha Sarvangasana - Lie flat on the back on the floor. Take a few deep breaths. Bend the knees, widen the legs at the knees and bring the heels in towards the buttocks. Keep the heels together and rest the outer sides firmly on the floor. Bring the hands by the side of the head and, with an exhalation, raise the trunk and arch the body up to rest the crown of the head on the floor. Pull the head as far back as possible by stretching the neck up and lifting the dorsal and lumbar regions of the back off the floor. Hold this position for a few seconds with normal breathing. ',
    'Balasana - Kneel with your knees and ankles close together (donâ€™t sit back on your heels yet). On an in-breath, lift your arms gently above your head and feel your whole back lengthen. Keep your neck and low back long and loose. Breathe steadily. On an out-breath, sit back on your heels and gently fold forward. Lower your forehead to the floor and rest your hands alongside your feet, palms facing upward. Breathe softly and steadily. Relax the muscles in your neck, shoulders and chest. If you find kneeling uncomfortable, try placing a rolled up mat or blanket under your ankles to take the pressure off the tops of your feet. You can place a block between your hips and heels if your knees feel tight, or rest your forehead on a block if your head does not easily reach the floor. Observe your breathing through the movement of your diaphragm pressed against your thighs.',
    'Navasana - Sit on the floor with your legs straight in front of you. Press your hands on the floor a little behind your hips, fingers pointing toward the feet, and strengthen the arms. Lift through the top of the sternum and lean back slightly. As you do this make sure your back does not round; continue to lengthen the front of your torso between the pubis and top sternum. Sit on the "tripod" of your two sitting bones and tailbone. Exhale and bend your knees, then lift your feet off the floor, so that the thighs are angled about 45-50 degrees relative to the floor. Lengthen your tailbone into the floor and lift your pubis toward your navel. If possible, slowly straighten your knees, raising the tips of your toes slightly above the level of your eyes. If this is not possible remain with your knees bent, perhaps lifting the shins parallel to the floor. Stretch your arms alongside the legs, parallel to each other and the floor. Spread the shoulder blades across your back and reach strongly out through the fingers. If this is not possible, keep the hands on the floor beside your hips or hold on to the backs of your thighs. While the lower belly should be firm, it should not get hard and thick. Try to keep the lower belly relatively flat. Press the heads of the thigh bones toward the floor to help anchor the pose and lift the top sternum. Breathe easily. Tip the chin slightly toward the sternum so the base of the skull lifts lightly away from the back of the neck.',
    'Phalakasana - Start in downward-facing dog, then inhale and draw your torso forward until the arms are perpendicular to the floor and the shoulders directly over the wrists, torso parallel to the floor. Press your outer arms inward and firm the bases of your index fingers into the floor. Firm your shoulder blades against your back, then spread them away from the spine. Also spread your collarbones away from the sternum. Press your front thighs up toward the ceiling, but resist your tailbone toward the floor as you lengthen it toward the heels. Lift the base of the skull away from the back of the neck and look straight down at the floor, keeping the throat and eyes soft. Plank Pose is one of the positions in the traditional Sun Salutation sequence. You can also perform this pose by itself and stay anywhere from 30 seconds to 1 minute.',
    'Marichyasana - Sit in Dandanasa (Staff pose), then bend your right knee and put the foot on the floor, with the heel as close to the right sitting bone as possible. Keep the left leg strong and rotated slightly inward; ground the head of the thigh bone into the floor. Press the back of the left heel and the base of the big toe away from the pelvis. Also press the inner right foot actively into the floor, but soften the inner right groin to receive the pubis as you twist. Grounding the straight-leg thigh and bent-knee foot will help you lengthen your spine, which is always the first prerequisite of a successful twist. With an exhalation, rotate your torso to the right and wrap your left arm around the right thigh. Hold the outer thigh with your left hand, then pull the thigh up as you release the right hip toward the floor. Press your right fingertips onto the floor just behind your pelvis to lift the torso slightly up and forward. Remember to keep your straight leg and bent-knee foot grounded. Sink the inner right groin deeper into the pelvis, then lengthen your front belly up out of the groin along the inner right thigh. Continue lengthening the spine with each inhalation, and twist a little more with each exhalation. Hug the thigh to your belly, then lean back against your shoulder blades into an upper-back backbend. Gently turn your head to the right to complete the twist in your cervical spine.',
    'Paschimottanasana - Unless you are very flexible, sit on a block to make the pose much easier. Alternatively, bend your knees, hold the soles of your feet and bring your chest to your thighs â€“ now gradually extend your legs. Another modification is to practice with straight legs while holding onto a belt that is looped around your feet. Fold forward from your hips on an out-breath. Extend the spine as far as you can (donâ€™t lead with your chin). Rest your hands on your legs. Align your head and spine. Keep your chest area open. Gently clasp your toes, ankles or whichever part of your legs you can reach. On an in-breath, lift your body and your abdominal and pelvic floor muscles and lengthen your spine. On your next out-breath fold softly forward, bending your elbows outward and keeping your neck and shoulders relaxed. Repeat for several breaths.',
    'Sarvangasana - Lie on your back. Bend your knees and bring them toward your chest. Place the palms of your hands on the ground on either side of your body. Draw up your abdominal muscles and gently rock your hips off the floor. Catch your hips with your hands and bring your elbows as close together as you can. Slip your shoulder blades under your back and lengthen your torso. Keep your knees bent toward your chest and check that your breathing is steady and smooth. Never fling yourself carelessly into shoulder stand. This posture requires precision and control so that you do not hurt your neck. Keep your head centered.',
    'Savasana - Lie flat on the back full length like a corpse. Keep the hands a little away from the thighs, with the palms up. Close the eyes. If possible place a black cloth folded four times over the eyes. Keep the heels together and the toes apart. To start with breathe deeply. Later the breathing should be fine and slow, with no jerky movements to disturb the spine or the body. Concentrate on deep and fine exhalations, in which the nostrils do not feel the warmth of breath. The lower jaw should hang loose and not be clenched. The tongue should not be disturbed, and even the pupils of the eyes should be kept completely passive. Relax completely and breathe out slowly.  If the mind wanders, pause without any strain after each slow exhalation. ',
