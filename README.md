This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The new-yoga-app (still a work in project, I'm about to add new functionalities) lets you create or choose a routine whatever your level is. If you are a beginner, you can choose ready-made routines. If you are more advanced you can build your own sequence. You can also check the instructions for detailed information about any posture and the time needed to finish the routine you chose or created.
